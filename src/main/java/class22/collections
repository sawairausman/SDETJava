//very big problem with arrays;
        //he arrays are fixed in size, once youve created an araay, and once you
        //have stored, later on when you want to store more values you wont be able to
          //do that.

        //arrrays are not classes. everything you want to do you have to wrtie your

        //limitations in array
        //1.they are fixed in size
        //2.theyare no build in methods present in the array

        //those classes don''t have those issues.

array list is dynamic in size.
is it going to allocate the memory consecutively
in arraylist after the class name we use <> diamont ooperator we write name of the class whose elements
and objects we want to store in it.we write the datatype.we are storing the object of e.g string class.
Arraylist<Struing>
<>these are called generics our code are not going to work properly.
if you don't write angle brackets you will be able to store numbers, you will be able to store strings,
you will create a mess. but who'ever is going to process the data the life of that person will be nightmare.
we have to put restrictions. someone might not even know what kind of data youve store inside it. this is called
generic arraylist
before java 8 it was alot of problems it was allowed to put any datatypes
now if someone tries to store anything other than string now we have restrictions.now we can only store string
type of data.this is possible with the help of generics
can we store primitive datatype if we specify it inside ? No

//the biggest problem with arrays. the arrays are fixed in size.
the size of arraylist is dynamic.
if we add elements it will increase in size,'if we decrease the size it will shrink..its will adjust size in run time.

1.you can waste space in array as we specifiy and we can waste the memorey if we don't use it array list is solving this problem
2. there are no built in methods in arrays. for arraylist you have methods.
//array list is designed for objects it takes 4 times more memoory..
whenever focus is speed use arrays

int this is primitive data type -> integer this is class call methods has instance methods and static methods
integer i - new integer(12) it is deprecated.. given special values like string

wrapper classes? still used int..it a wrapper inside in form of the class
Double
Boolean
primitives cannot have methods..only class can have methods. primitives are limited
in life..to perforn day to day operation they created wrapper class
collection framework has thousands of class and is designed in a way to work with wrapper class
and not the primitive.
