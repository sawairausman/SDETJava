 MethodOverriding happens when same name method is present in parent as well as
    in child class.

    MethodOverriding:
        When we have exact same methods in parent and child class. We call it
        method Overriding.so child class has its own implementation of it own
    Why should we learn about Overriding:
        Method Overriding gives us a lot flexibility for example if we don't like
        a method from the parent class we can override it/change.


        Method Overriding:
            it's when a sub class has the exact same method as parent method but a different
            implementation.
        What are the benefits of Method Overriding.
            1) Flexibility(if you don't like something from the parent class you can override it).
            2) Cleaner code
        Rules:
            1) if we want to override a method in the child class return type,method name
            and parameters they must be same.
            2) private methods can't be overridden.
            3) We can't override constructors.
            4) static methods  We can't override static method. which means we will not be able to write dynamic
               code or will not able to use polymorphism.
interview question
               can we override the main method but we can overload the main method
                can we overload the private method in same cass yes

                final keyword no overriding in child class
                overloading is possible with final

                as final before the name parent class..no more extentions
                no more inheritance




        Syntax:
            class Parent{

            void eat(){
            sout "Fish"
            }
            }
           class Child extends Parent{

           void eat(){
           sout "Chicken"
           }
           }
